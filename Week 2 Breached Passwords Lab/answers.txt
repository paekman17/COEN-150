1. What is your result from the Side Note?

1,000 salts * 10,000 possible passwords = 10,000,000 possibilities


2. If attempting to crack every password, which table for attacks would be bigger,
salted or unsalted?

Salted


3. If attempting to crack every password, which dictionary attack takes longer to
complete, salted or unsalted?

Salted


4. Would salting help against targeted attacks (i.e. you want to hack one, specific
account), assuming you have the breached data?

No, if we know which user we're targeting, their hash, and the respective salt for their password, it would be the same
as trying a combination of passwords without the salt. Salting is only beneficial if we're trying to protect several
users that may (or may not) have the same password.


5. If your password is salted and stored properly, do you still need a unique,
complex password? Why?

Yes, it would take a hacker much more time to try and predict a user's password with various characters rather than one
that's common or simple. As we demonstrated in this lab, as long as we have some common passwords and breached data,
it's relatively easy to gather passwords from other users. Also, I always say it's better safe than sorry :)
